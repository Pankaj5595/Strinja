## Overview 🌟

Strinja.Shop is a full-stack MERN-based e-commerce website developed to showcase and sell handmade nail and string art products.  
I worked on this project to understand real-world application development, including frontend design, backend APIs, and database integration.

The platform focuses on providing a smooth shopping experience for users while also offering basic admin-side functionality for managing products and orders.
